## About me

I believe, code have to be covered by tests, readable and maintainable.

### Short intro

As a python backend developer, mostly on Python3. Starting from using Python to automate some daily routine, when I was System Administrator, I had dived into programming. For the most projects I used PostgreSQL and know how to build and profile queries.
